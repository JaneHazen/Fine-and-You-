# Fine-and-You-

At my first job out of college I worked at a rehab that focused on Dialectical Behavior Therapy
(DBT), a treatment that encourages people to be mindful of their emotions. To help followers of
DBT track how their emotions shift, I created an app that will text you every day, wait for a
numeric response, and graph these daily “feels” in a simple, elegant line graph.
